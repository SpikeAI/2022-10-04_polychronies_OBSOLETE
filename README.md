    Why do neurons communicate through spikes? By definition, spikes are all-or-none
    neural events which occur at continuous times. In other words, spikes are on one
    side binary, existing or not without further details, and on the other can occur
    at any asynchronous time, without the need for a centralized clock. This stands
    in stark contrast to the analog representation of values and the discretized timing
    classically used in digital processing and at the base of modern-day neural networks.
    As neural systems almost systematically use this so-called event-based representation
    in the living world, a better understanding of this phenomenon remains a fundamental
    challenge in neurobiology in order to better interpret the profusion of recorded
    data. With the growing need for intelligent embedded systems, it also emerges as
    a new computing paradigm to enable the efficient operation of a new class of sensors
    and event-based computers, called neuromorphic, which could enable significant gains
    in computation time and energy consumption --- a major societal issue in the era
    of the digital economy and global warming. In this review paper, we provide evidence
    from biology, theory and engineering that the precise timing of spikes plays a crucial
    role in our understanding of the efficiency of neural networks.
