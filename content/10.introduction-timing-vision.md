## introduction

### timing encodes profile

Most importantly, it will provide with a detection ability requiring only a few spikes, and therefore in line with the performance observed in biological systems, like the ability for humans to detect the presence of an animal in an image in a few milliseconds (Thorpe et al (1996). Speed of processing in the human visual system. Nature, 381(6582), 520-522). Such biological observations would serve as benchmarks to compare our proposed architecture  to conventional solutions.
