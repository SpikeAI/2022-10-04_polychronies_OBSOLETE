Memory traces in dynamical systems [@doi:10.1073/pnas.0804451105] We address these issues by applying Fisher information theory to dynamical systems driven by time-dependent signals corrupted by noise.  Memory capacity is constrained by architecture: "This limit can be realized by feedforward structures with divergent fan out that distributes the signal across neurons, thereby avoiding saturation."
