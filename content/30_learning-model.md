## Learning to detect polychronous groups

### Learning delays: STDP

spike time coding in a neuron: We will describe the Spike-Time Dependent Plasticity (STDP) rule which implement an unsupervised learning aiming at optimizing the detection of polychronous patterns, that is volleys of spikes which are synchronized, up to some stable pattern of pre-synaptic delays. This STDP rule will be based by the inversion of the generative model for spike formation and will therefore be derived by a Bayesian approach. This will decouple the active synapses (similarly to a logistic regression) from the values of possible synaptic delays.
