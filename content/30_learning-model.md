#### Neural Variability and Sampling-Based Probabilistic Representations in the Visual Cortex [@Orban2016]

 * Stochastic sampling links perceptual uncertainty to neural response variability
 * Model accounts for independent changes in strength and variability of responses
 * Model predicts relationship between noise, signal, and spontaneous correlations
 * Stimulus statistics dependence of response statistics is explained
