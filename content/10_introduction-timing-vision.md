## Introduction: Precise temporal patterns in the brain

### Ultra fast neural codes for ultra fast vision

Let us start our review of the state of the art on the role of dynamics in vision by presenting some surprising results that have been obtained in neuroscience. Indeed, Simon Thorpe's group has shown during the last decades numerous examples demonstrating that humans can categorize briefly presented images in a fraction of a second. Its first experiment consisted in asking subjects to categorize images that do or do not contain animals [@Thorpe1996]. The results showed that humans were able to perform this task very well (with a success rate of more than 95%) but above all that a differential activity for the two categories of images could be observed by electroencephalography, showing that this differentiation emerges at a very early latency in neuronal activity. These results have been extended to several species including primates but also extended to different experimental protocols and have shown for example that the response could be extremely fast of the order of 120 ms when the task was to perform a saccade [@Kirchner06].

This fast processing also explains the surprising experiments of fast serial detection which consists in presenting a fast succession of different images and to decode via the EEG if the observer can detect for example the presence of an animal. The performances decrease progressively as the frequency of presentation of the images increases. However, it has been shown in the macaque that a significant performance could be maintained with an image presentation time of only 14 ms per image [@doi:10.1162/089892901564199].

This speed of the visual cortex, although surprising, is quite compatible with the latencies that are recorded at the neuro-physiological level. Indeed, when an image is presented on the retina, the visual information is rapidly propagated to the thalamus and then to the primary visual cortex takes about 55 ms in the macaque [@doi:10.1007/978-1-4757-9625-4_5], see Figure [@fig:thorpe]. This functioning of visual processing as a forward pass is most prominent in fast processing but can be complemented with feedback loops from the higher areas to the sensory areas [@doi:10/ccv3w2].

### How timing encodes analogous profile

An important characteristic of neuronal information is that it consists mainly in the transfer of action potentials, or spikes, which consist of brief impulses that propagate along the axons of neurons. These have the particularity of being essentially binary in their amplitude (that is to say, they are prototypical, all or nothing). An important consequence of the speed of processing is that it implies that it is carried out using only very few spikes. Indeed, if we consider that a behavioral response in only 120 ms consists of about ten processing stages following the "forward" pathways of the visual system, then this imposes that the processing in a single area is performed with a reduced number of spikes.

Note also that depending on how an in vitro cell is driven, this may influence the reliability of spike timing in neocortical neurons [@doi:10.1126/science.7770778].

![Latency coding. An input analog profile is encoded in latencies: the higher the contrast, the shorter the latency. In this example, one generates at most one spike per neuron. From [@https://www.cnrs.fr/mi/IMG/pdf/parissep14-m-thorpe-small.pdf]](images/roc.jpg){#fig:roc}

At the level of dynamic processing of visual information, it has been shown that an encoding of the values of luminance imminence in the image instead of the retina [@doi:10.1126/science.1149639]. Notably one can appreciate in figure 1 that the response of ganglion cells to visual gratings that are flashed onto the retina. The authors showed that the neuronal response could be encoded in the latency of the response and not only in the frequency of discharge as is often assumed. In figure 4 of the same article, these results are extended to natural images and show a qualitatively similar behavior. The conclusion of the authors is that the discharge latency of the neurons allows to encode spatial characteristics of the image. First-spike latency codes are a feasible mechanism for information transfer even when biologically plausible estimates of stimulus onset are taken into account [@doi:10.1073/pnas.0610368104]. Interestingly, such fine latency effect can be at the origin of somme visual illusions, for instance the illusion of false colors in the [Benham Top](https://michaelbach.de/ot/col-Benham/index.html) based based on center-surround interactions in the parvocellular pathway [@doi:10.1016/j.neunet.2004.05.005].

Similar results have been demonstrated through neurophysiological recordings in the primary visual cortex and show that different levels of visual activity will induce different levels of neuronal discharge latency in the primary visual area [@doi:10/dqt5cm]. Many models have used these properties in temporal coding to build fast image categorization networks. These models take the form of artificial spiking neural networks (SNNs) and have been able to demonstrate their practical applications for image categorization [@Perrinet2004]. This work has been extended to include unsupervised learning capabilities and we have recently developed a SNN architecture that allows to categorize images of different classes in only a few spikes [@Grimaldi2021; @Grimaldi2022]. This type of modeling is extremely important with respect to the development of a new generation of cameras called Silicon Cameras which, instead of using a basic frame-based representation, uses a representation similar to the one we have just described and which consists in representing the image by events [@arxiv:2201.12673]. This type of modeling often uses the classical architecture of image categorization developed in deep learning while adapting it to the specificity of the event-based representation [@arXiv:1912.11443]. Note also that timing is not entirely sensorial or internal but in [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1921226117], they found that "timing accuracy was improved when the environment afforded cues that rats can incorporate into motor routines. Timing, at least in animals, may thus be fundamentally embodied and situated." Altogether, these results show that "that like other senses, vision relies heavily on temporal strategies and temporal neural codes to extract and represent spatial information" [@doi:10.1016/j.tics.2018.07.009].

### From synfire chains...

The analysis of generic raster plots reveals particular traits that hint at the role of a precise timing. For instance, the firing rate is highly irregular [@doi:10.1523/JNEUROSCI.13-01-00334.1993], which makes it inconsistent with temporal integration of random EPSPs. It has also been observed that the response of a neuron in a cortical slice to a current step could be highly non-reproducible, where the first spike is aligned but the subsequent spike times tend to diffuse for independent repetitions of the stimulation [@doi:10.1126/science.7770778] (see Figure [@fig:mainen]). When driven by a highly dynamic *frozen* noise, the output spikes are highly reproducible. This is consistent with the differential role of different stimulus frequencies on the reliability of spike timing reported in [@10.1093/cercor/7.6.487] : "we found that, as expected given the resistive and capacitive properties of cortical neurons, low frequencies have a larger effect on the membrane potential of cortical neurons than do higher frequencies. However, increasing the amount of gamma range fluctuations in a stimulus leads to more precise timing of action potentials".

![The timing of the spikes produced following the repetition of a step stimuli is less reproducible than that to a noisy stimulus. While this seems paradoxical at first sight, this is due to the use of the same *frozen* nois at each repetition and highlight the highly reproducible pattern of spikes when it is driven by a highly dynamic input. See this [notebook](https://github.com/laurentperrinet/2022_UE-neurosciences-computationnelles/blob/master/C_MainenSejnowski1995.ipynb) for a replication of this result using a simple LIF model.](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/77f4a48a0fe8f98ffab3c1f21dca1e74286b14d47c17120ee9627f3351fcd5e7/687474703a2f2f692e737461636b2e696d6775722e636f6d2f69786e727a2e706e67){#fig:mainen}

In his book "Corticonics" [@Abeles1991], Moshe Abeles asked if the role of cortical neurons is whether to integrate synaptic inputs or rather to detect coincidences in temporal spiking patterns. The book gradually leads the reader from the macroscopic cortical anatomy and standard electrophysiological properties of single neurons to neural network models. While the first hypothesis favors the rate coding theory, the second possibility highlights the need for temporal precision in the neural code [@Paugam12]. The book then demonstrates that this could take the form of "synfire chains", that is synchronous activity on subsets of neurons which could be propagated in a stable fashion. Since, numerous studies demonstrated the emergence of synchronicity in neuron population activity [@doi:10/gm79hh], efficient encoding thanks to the use of spike latencies [@Perrinet2004; @doi:10.1126/science.1149639] or precise timing in the auditory system [@https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/30941; @doi:10.1523/JNEUROSCI.10-10-03227.1990]. All these findings, and more [@doi:10.1023/B:NACO.0000027755.02868.60], highlight the importance of the temporal aspect of the neural code and suggest the existence of repeated spatio-temporal patterns in the spike train.

It was shown that a simple model may allow the propagation of such synfire chains [@pmid:11665761]. This model considers the dynamics of leaky integrate-of-fire neurons in different groups of similar size. Each neuron of one group is connected by an excitatory synapse to the next. When a pulse is elicited in the first group, this may generate a spike in the next group. Depending on the weight value, this new activity may get more or less synchronized than the previous pulse (as measured by the standard deviation of spike times in the pulse). Recursively applying this to a sequence of groups generates either a synfire propagation or not. A simple simulation is shown in Figure [@fig:diesman]. A crucial aspect of this emergence is in particular the balance between excitation and inhibition [@doi:10.1111/j.1460-9568.2008.06434.x]. This was for instance modeled by  feed-forward inhibition which is a fine-scaled latency mechanism that is an essential ingredient in modelling push-pull effects in the primary visual cortex [@doi:10.3389/fncir.2016.00037].


![Simulation of a synfire propagation [using Brian](https://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/frompapers.Diesmann_et_al_1999.html). The model consists of 10 groups of 100 neurons each. A pulse with a given jitter is generated in the first group which here generates a pulse after a certain processing delay in the second group with a lower jitter. This allows the propagation of the synchronous activity along the chain of the neural groups.](https://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/_images/frompapers.Diesmann_et_al_1999.1.png){#fig:diesman}

Attempts have been made to detect such synfire chains in neurobiological data [@doi:10.1152/jn.01245.2007]: "The sensitivity is high enough to detect synfire chain activity in simultaneous single-unit recordings of 100 to 200 neurons from such data, enabling application to experimental data in the near future." Further models have shown that such synfire chains could be embedded in topographies [@doi:10.1162/089976603321780290] or using conductance-based neurons with feed-forward inhibition to improve the robustness of the propagation [@doi:10.1007/s10827-010-0240-9]. In particular, this was implemented using the pyNN language [@doi:10.3389/neuro.11.011.2008] both in CPU-based and neuromorphic hardware [@doi:10.3389/fnins.2013.00011] (see Figure [@fig:pynn]).

![A pyNN implementation of a Synfire chain with feedforward inhibition. The background is only utilized in the original model, where it is implemented as random Gaussian current. For the presented hardware implementation it has been omitted due to network size constraints. As compensation for missing background stimuli, the resting potential was increased to ensure a comparable excitability of the neurons. The state space gives the duration of synfire chains as a function of the protocol's parameters and compares (C) CPU to (D) neuromorphic implementations.](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/39056/fnins-07-00011-r2/image_m/fnins-07-00011-g004.jpg){#fig:pynn}

Note also that synchronicity may explain some unintuitive results. Indeed it has been shown that  thalamocortical synapses are relatively weak compared to the amount of intra-cortical activity. However, this pathway is sufficient to drive the cortex as this input is more often synchronously active [@doi:10.1126/science.1124593].

Some experimental results show the emergence of synchrony, for instance in motor cortical function [@doi:10.1126/science.278.5345.1950]. Interestingly, authors showed that "Accurate spike synchronization occurred in relation to external events (stimuli, movements) and was commonly accompanied by discharge rate modulations but without precise time locking of the spikes to these external events. Spike synchronization also occurred in relation to purely internal events (stimulus expectancy), where firing rate modulations were distinctly absent. These findings indicate that internally generated synchronization of individual spike discharges may subserve the cortical organization of cognitive motor processes." Moreover, such emergence could change over the learning period involved in learning a task [@doi:10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1554-09.2009] and showed some tuning to  to movement direction and reaction time [@doi:10.1007/s00422-002-0385-3]. It is important to note that synchronous events tended to lock to LFP beta waves [@doi:10.1038/s41598-018-22990-7], and was extended to larger assemblies [@doi:10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4375-15.2016] using statistical methods (see [@sec:detection]).


#### TODO .. to traveling waves ...


[@Bringuier99]

Statistical dependencies in the responses of sensory neurons govern both the amount of stimulus information conveyed and the means by which downstream neurons can extract it.  This is put in evidenceby analysing the functional significance of correlated firing in a complete population of macaque parasol retinal ganglion cells using a model of multi-neuron spike responses [@doi:10.1038/nature07140]. This show precise spatio-temporal differences in this recurrently connected assembly. The different aspects of information in the data are evaluated by a decoding strategy highlighting the role of correlations. A similar dataset used in [@doi:10.1016/j.neuron.2005.03.026, @doi:10.1038/nature04701] is available from M. Berry's lab [@url:https://dataspace.princeton.edu/handle/88435/dsp015425kd84r].


The stimulus-evoked population response in visual cortex of awake monkey is a propagating wave
Propagating waves occur in many excitable media and were recently found in neural systems from retina to neocortex. While propagating waves are clearly present under anaesthesia, whether they also appear during awake and conscious states remains unclear. One possibility is that these waves are systematically missed in trial-averaged data, due to variability. Here we present a method for detecting propagating waves in noisy multichannel recordings. Applying this method to single-trial voltage-sensitive dye imaging data, we show that the stimulus-evoked population response in primary visual cortex of the awake monkey propagates as a travelling wave, with consistent dynamics across trials. A network model suggests that this reliability is the hallmark of the horizontal fibre network of superficial cortical layers. Propagating waves with similar properties occur independently in secondary visual cortex, but maintain precise phase relations with the waves in primary visual cortex. These results show that, in response to a visual stimulus, propagating waves are systematically evoked in several visual areas, generating a consistent spatiotemporal frame for further neuronal interactions. [@Muller14]

Advanced recording techniques have enabled the identification of travelling waves of neuronal activity in different areas of the cortex. Sejnowski and colleagues review these findings, consider the mechanisms by which travelling waves are generated and evaluate their possible roles in cortical function. [@Muller18]


#### Spontaneous traveling waves

Spontaneous traveling waves naturally emerge from horizontal fiber time delays and travel through locally asynchronous-irregular states [@doi:10.1038/s41467-021-26175-1].

Studies of sensory-evoked neuronal responses often focus on mean spike rates, with fluctuations treated as internally-generated noise. However, fluctuations of spontaneous activity, often organized as traveling waves, shape stimulus-evoked responses and perceptual sensitivity. The mechanisms underlying these waves are unknown. Further, it is unclear whether waves are consistent with the low rate and weakly correlated “asynchronous-irregular” dynamics observed in cortical recordings. Here, we describe a large-scale computational model with topographically-organized connectivity and conduction delays relevant to biological scales. We find that spontaneous traveling waves are a general property of these networks. The traveling waves that occur in the model are sparse, with only a small fraction of neurons participating in any individual wave. Consequently, they do not induce measurable spike correlations and remain consistent with locally asynchronous irregular states. Further, by modulating local network state, they can shape responses to incoming inputs as observed in vivo.


#### Spike Synchronization and Rate Modulation Differentially Involved in Motor Cortical Function [@doi:10.1126/science.278.5345.1950]

It is now commonly accepted that planning and execution of movements are based on distributed processing by neuronal populations in motor cortical areas. It is less clear, though, how these populations organize dynamically to cope with the momentary computational demands. Simultaneously recorded activities of neurons in the primary motor cortex of monkeys during performance of a delayed-pointing task exhibited context-dependent, rapid changes in the patterns of coincident action potentials. Accurate spike synchronization occurred in relation to external events (stimuli, movements) and was commonly accompanied by discharge rate modulations but without precise time locking of the spikes to these external events. Spike synchronization also occurred in relation to purely internal events (stimulus expectancy), where firing rate modulations were distinctly absent. These findings indicate that internally generated synchronization of individual spike discharges may subserve the cortical organization of cognitive motor processes.


[@Chemla19]

Our approach would be distinct than these approaches from us and colleagues as we will directly deal with delays in the system at the presynaptic level.

there are temporal delays in the nervous system, both at the neural [@doi:10.1007/s00422-014-0620-8] and behavioral [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005068] levels. Extending this knowledge to the optimization of delays in a SNN will provide a breakthrough in the efficiency of these networks.

#### TODO ... and to synfire braids and polychronous groups

 * [@Bienenstock1995] : from synfire chains to Synfire braids

In neuronal models, an efficient use or detection of these spatio-temporal patterns embedded in the spike train comes with the integration of heterogeneous delays [@doi:10/ch29r4; @doi:10/f6chbq; @doi:10.1016/j.neucom.2020.03.079]. Notably, Izhikevich [@Izhikevich2006] introduced the notion of polychronous groups (PGs) as a repetitive motif of spikes defined by a subset of neurons with different, yet precise,  spiking delays. This representation has a much greater information capacity in comparison to other neural coding approaches through their connectivity and the possible coexistence of numerous superposed PGs.

 * A notable exception is the polychronization model of Izhikevich [@Izhikevich2006], which combined the construction of a random recurrent model of spiking neurons including such delays and whose weights evolved with a Spike-Time Dependent Plasticity (STDP) learning rule. In this model, raster plot analysis showed repeated activation of Polychronous Groups (PGs), i.e., specific spike patterns with a specific sequence of activations.
