## Abstract {.page_break_before}

The response of a biological neuron depends largely on the precise timing of the sequence of presynaptic spikes as they reach the basal dendritic tree. This *event-based representation* present in the neuronal code is essential in understanding information processing in the brain but also applies to other fields, for instance to the output of an event-based camera. However, most neuronal models do not take advantage of this minute temporal dimension, especially in exploiting the variety of synaptic delays on the dendritic tree.

Following the terminology of [@Izhikevich2006], we will define such motifs of precise temporal patterns as **polychronous groups** and this manuscript reviews current litterature on *polychrony detection* in generic raster plots. It is work in progress, where anybody interested can *openly* join.

We will first review some biological and theoretical evidence for polychrony in the neural information processing. We will then present some models for the detection of such polychronous groups in arbitrary raster plots, synthetic, biological or artificial (notably from event-based cameras). Then, we will try to outline some possible strategies for learning these patterns and finally discuss possible perspectives.
