### outline

The rest of this review paper is organized as follows:

* polychronization

* We review theoretical foundations of spike time coding in a neuron: We will describe the Spike-Time Dependent Plasticity (STDP) rule which implement an unsupervised learning aiming at optimizing the detection of polychronous patterns, that is volleys of spikes which are synchronized, up to some stable pattern of pre-synaptic delays. This STDP rule will be based by the inversion of the generative model for spike formation and will therefore be derived by a Bayesian approach. This will decouple the active synapses (similarly to a logistic regression) from the values of possible synaptic delays.

* Application to Image processing using sparse spiking representations: Using the core computational unit defined, extension of the computation to a topographic representation similar to that observed in the primary visual cortex of mammals. design of micro-circuits with specific lateral interactions will allow us to design efficient micro-circuits for the sparse representation of images.

* Discussion on Ultra-fast vision:  existing datasets recorded in natural settings or indoor scenes with event-based cameras.
