This section has provided evidence that polychronous groups are an important apsect of information representation in biology with important application in data analysis and neuromorphic engineering. The rest of this review paper is organized as follows.

First, we will review models for the detection of polychronous groups:

* We review theoretical and computational foundations of PG detection in models.

* Application to Image processing using sparse spiking representations: Using the core computational unit defined, extension of the computation to a topographic representation similar to that observed in the primary visual cortex of mammals. design of micro-circuits with specific lateral interactions will allow us to design efficient micro-circuits for the sparse representation of images.

Finally we will discuss future avenues for effective PG detection and learning in event streams.
