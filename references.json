    "abstract": "  For a biological agent operating under environmental pressure, energy consumption and reaction times are of critical importance. Similarly, engineered systems are optimized for short time-to-solution and low energy-to-solution characteristics. At the level of neuronal implementation, this implies achieving the desired results with as few and as early spikes as possible. With time-to-first-spike coding both of these goals are inherently emerging features of learning. Here, we describe a rigorous derivation of a learning rule for such first-spike times in networks of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons, relying solely on input and output spike times, and show how this mechanism can implement error backpropagation in hierarchical spiking networks. Furthermore, we emulate our framework on the BrainScaleS-2 neuromorphic system and demonstrate its capability of harnessing the system's speed and energy characteristics. Finally, we examine how our approach generalizes to other neuromorphic platforms by studying how its performance is affected by typical distortive effects induced by neuromorphic substrates. ",

    "abstract": "  The plasticity of the conduction delay between neurons plays a fundamental role in learning. However, the exact underlying mechanisms in the brain for this modulation is still an open problem. Understanding the precise adjustment of synaptic delays could help us in developing effective brain-inspired computational models in providing aligned insights with the experimental evidence. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised biologically plausible learning rule for adjusting the synaptic delays in spiking neural networks. Then, we provided some mathematical proofs to show that our learning rule gives a neuron the ability to learn repeating spatio-temporal patterns. Furthermore, the experimental results of applying an STDP-based spiking neural network equipped with our proposed delay learning rule on Random Dot Kinematogram indicate the efficacy of the proposed delay learning rule in extracting temporal features.

    "abstract": "  Fitting network models to neural activity is an important tool in neuroscience. A popular approach is to model a brain area with a probabilistic recurrent spiking network whose parameters maximize the likelihood of the recorded activity. Although this is widely used, we show that the resulting model does not produce realistic neural activity. To correct for this, we suggest to augment the log-likelihood with terms that measure the dissimilarity between simulated and recorded activity. This dissimilarity is defined via summary statistics commonly used in neuroscience and the optimization is efficient because it relies on back-propagation through the stochastically simulated spike trains. We analyze this method theoretically and show empirically that it generates more realistic activity statistics. We find that it improves upon other fitting algorithms for spiking network models like GLMs (Generalized Linear Models) which do not usually rely on back-propagation. This new fitting algorithm also enables the consideration of hidden neurons which is otherwise notoriously hard, and we show that it can be crucial when trying to infer the network connectivity from spike recordings.

    "abstract": "  The principled design and discovery of biologically- and physically-informed models of neuronal dynamics has been advancing since the mid-twentieth century. Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) have accelerated this progress. This review article gives a high-level overview of the approaches across different scales of organization and levels of abstraction. The studies covered in this paper include fundamental models in computational neuroscience, nonlinear dynamics, data-driven methods, as well as emergent practices. While not all of these models span the intersection of neuroscience, AI, and system dynamics, all of them do or can work in tandem as generative models, which, as we argue, provide superior properties for the analysis of neuroscientific data. We discuss the limitations and unique dynamical traits of brain data and the complementary need for hypothesis- and data-driven modeling. By way of conclusion, we present several hybrid generative models from recent literature in scientific machine learning, which can be efficiently deployed to yield interpretable models of neural dynamics.

    "abstract": "  Neuromorphic engineering has led to the necessary process of rethinking of how we process and integrate information, analyze data, and use the resulting insights to improve computation and avoid the current high power and latency of Artificial Intelligence (AI) hardware. Current neuromorphic processors are, however, limited by digital technologies, which cannot reproduce the abilities of biological neural computation in terms of power, latency and area cost. In this paper, we show that the combined use of the dynamic properties of memristors to implement a model of synaptic integration and the determination of the correct level of abstraction of biological neural networks has the potential to open a new range of capabilities for neuromorphic processors. We test this approach using a novel three-terminal LixWO3 electrochemical memristor, by deriving its conductance model and using it to emulate synaptic temporal kernel computation in the context of a pattern recognition task. We show that these devices allow for robust results with no loss in precision while opening the path for an energy efficient approach to build novel bio-inspired processing units in silicon. ",

If recurrent feedback is important in generating orientation selectivity, the initial part of the neuronal response should be relatively poorly selective, and full orientation selectivity should only appear after a delay. Thus, by examining the dynamics of the neuronal responses it should be possible to assess the importance of feedback processes in the development of orientation selectivity. The results were base on a sample of 259 cells recorded in two monkeys, of which 89% were visually responsive. Of these, approximately two-thirds were orientation selective. Response latency varied considerably between neurons, ranging from a minimum of 41 ms to over 150 ms, although most had latencies of 50–70 ms. Orientation tuning (defined as the bandwidth at half-height) ranged from 16 deg to over 90 deg, with a mean value of around 55 deg. By examining the selectivity of these different neurons by 10-ms time slices, starting at the onset of the neuronal response, we found that the orientation selectivity of virtually every neuron was fully developed at the very start of the neuronal response. Indeed, many neurons showed a marked tendency to respond at somewhat longer latencies to stimuli that were nonoptimally oriented, with the result that orientation selectivity was highest at the very start of the neuronal response. Furthermore, there was no evidence that the neurons with the shortest onset latencies were less selective. Such evidence is inconsistent with the hypothesis that recurrent intracortical feedback plays an important role in the generation of orientation selectivity. Instead, we suggest that orientation selectivity is primarily generated using feedforward mechanisms, including feedforward inhibition. Such a strategy has the advantage of allowing orientation to be computed rapidly, and avoids the initially poorly selective neuronal responses that characterize processing involving recurrent loops.</jats:p>",

However, fluctuations of spontaneous activity, often organized as traveling waves, shape stimulus-evoked responses and perceptual sensitivity. The mechanisms underlying these waves are unknown. Further, it is unclear whether waves are consistent with the low rate and weakly correlated “asynchronous-irregular” dynamics observed in cortical recordings. Here, we describe a large-scale computational model with topographically-organized connectivity and conduction delays relevant to biological scales. We find that spontaneous traveling waves are a general property of these networks. The traveling waves that occur in the model are sparse, with only a small fraction of neurons participating in any individual wave. Consequently, they do not induce measurable spike correlations and remain consistent with locally asynchronous irregular states. Further, by modulating local network state, they can shape responses to incoming inputs as observed in vivo.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The hippocampus plays a critical role in episodic memory: the sequential representation of visited places and experienced events. This function is mirrored by hippocampal activity that self organizes into sequences of neuronal activation that integrate spatiotemporal information. What are the underlying mechanisms of such integration is still unknown. Single cell activity was recently shown to combine time and distance information; however, it remains unknown whether a degree of tuning between space and time can be defined at the network level. Here, combining daily calcium imaging of CA1 sequence dynamics in running head-fixed mice and network modeling, we show that CA1 network activity tends to represent a specific combination of space and time at any given moment, and that the degree of tuning can shift within a continuum from 1 day to the next. Our computational model shows that this shift in tuning can happen under the control of the external drive power. We propose that extrinsic global inputs shape the nature of spatiotemporal integration in the hippocampus at the population level depending on the task at hand, a hypothesis which may guide future experimental studies.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Performing a stereotyped behavior successfully over time requires both maintaining performance quality and adapting efficiently to environmental or physical changes affecting performance. The bird song system is a paradigmatic example of learning a stereotyped behavior and therefore is a good place to study the interaction of these two goals. Through a model of bird song learning, we show how instability in neural representation of stable behavior confers advantages for adaptation and maintenance with minimal cost to performance quality. A precise, temporally sparse sequence from the premotor nucleus HVC is crucial to the performance of song in songbirds. We find that learning in the presence of sequence variations facilitates rapid relearning after shifts in the target song or muscle structure and results in decreased error with neuron loss. This robustness is due to the prevention of the buildup of correlations in the learned connectivity. In the absence of sequence variations, these correlations grow, due to the relatively low dimensionality of the exploratory variation in comparison with the number of plastic synapses. Our results suggest one would expect to see variability in neural systems executing stereotyped behaviors, and this variability is an advantageous feature rather than a challenge to overcome.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>How animals adapt their behavior according to regular time intervals between events is not well understood, especially when intervals last several seconds. One possibility is that animals use disembodied internal neuronal representations of time to decide when to initiate a given action at the end of an interval. However, animals rarely remain immobile during time intervals but tend to perform stereotyped behaviors, raising the possibility that motor routines improve timing accuracy. To test this possibility, we used a task in which rats, freely moving on a motorized treadmill, could obtain a reward if they approached it after a fixed interval. Most animals took advantage of the treadmill length and its moving direction to develop, by trial-and-error, the same motor routine whose execution resulted in the precise timing of their reward approaches. Noticeably, when proficient animals did not follow this routine, their temporal accuracy decreased. Then, naïve animals were trained in modified versions of the task designed to prevent the development of this routine. Compared to rats trained in the first protocol, these animals didn’t reach a comparable level of timing accuracy. Altogether, our results indicate that timing accuracy in rats is improved when the environment affords cues that animals can incorporate into motor routines.</jats:p>",

Frequent body, head, and eye movements constantly bring new images onto the retina for brief periods, challenging our understanding of the neural code for vision. We report that certain retinal ganglion cells encode the spatial structure of a briefly presented image in the relative timing of their first spikes. This code is found to be largely invariant to stimulus contrast and robust to noisy fluctuations in response latencies. Mechanistically, the observed response characteristics result from different kinetics in two retinal pathways (“ON” and “OFF”) that converge onto ganglion cells. This mechanism allows the retina to rapidly and reliably transmit new spatial information with the very first spikes emitted by a neural population.</jats:p>",

We found that reliably and continually changing cell assemblies in the rat hippocampus appeared not only during spatial navigation but also in the absence of changing environmental or body-derived inputs. During the delay period of a memory task, each moment in time was characterized by the activity of a particular assembly of neurons. Identical initial conditions triggered a similar assembly sequence, whereas different conditions gave rise to different sequences, thereby predicting behavioral choices, including errors. Such sequences were not formed in control (nonmemory) tasks.

It is less clear, though, how these populations organize dynamically to cope with the momentary computational demands. Simultaneously recorded activities of neurons in the primary motor cortex of monkeys during performance of a delayed-pointing task exhibited context-dependent, rapid changes in the patterns of coincident action potentials. Accurate spike synchronization occurred in relation to external events (stimuli, movements) and was commonly accompanied by discharge rate modulations but without precise time locking of the spikes to these external events. Spike synchronization also occurred in relation to purely internal events (stimulus expectancy), where firing rate modulations were distinctly absent. These findings indicate that internally generated synchronization of individual spike discharges may subserve the cortical organization of cognitive motor processes.</jats:p>",

In this model cortical tissue is composed of a superposition of feedforward subnetworks (chains) each capable of transmitting packets of synchronized spikes with high reliability. Computations are then carried out by interactions of these chains. Experimental evidence for synfire chains has so far been limited to inference from detection of a few repeating spatiotemporal neuronal firing patterns in multiple single-unit recordings. Demonstration that such patterns actually come from synfire activity would require finding a meta organization among many detected patterns, as yet an untried approach. In contrast we present here a new method that directly visualizes the repetitive occurrence of synfire activity even in very large data sets of multiple single-unit recordings. We achieve reliability and sensitivity by appropriately averaging over neuron space (identities) and time. We test the method with data from a large-scale balanced recurrent network simulation containing 50 randomly activated synfire chains. The sensitivity is high enough to detect synfire chain activity in simultaneous single-unit recordings of 100 to 200 neurons from such data, enabling application to experimental data in the near future. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In order to detect members of a functional group (cell assembly) in simultaneously recorded neuronal spiking activity, we adopted the widely used operational definition that membership in a common assembly is expressed in near-simultaneous spike activity. Unitary event analysis, a statistical method to detect the significant occurrence of coincident spiking activity in stationary data, was recently developed (see the companion article in this issue). The technique for the detection of unitary events is based on the assumption that the underlying processes are stationary in time. This requirement, however, is usually not fulfilled in neuronal data. Here we describe a method that properly normalizes for changes of rate: the unitary events by moving window analysis (UEMWA). Analysis for unitary events is performed separately in overlapping time segments by sliding a window of constant width along the data. In each window, stationarity is assumed. Performance and sensitivity are demonstrated by use of simulated spike trains of independently firing neurons, into which coincident events are inserted. If cortical neurons organize dynamically into functional groups, the occurrence of near-simultaneous spike activity should be time varying and related to behavior and stimuli. UEMWA also accounts for these potentially interesting nonstationarities and allows locating them in time. The potential of the new method is illustrated by results from multiple single-unit recordings from frontal and motor cortical areas in awake, behaving monkey. </jats:p>",

The network consists of cortical spiking neurons with axonal conduction delays and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP); a ready-to-use MATLAB code is included. It exhibits sleeplike oscillations, gamma (40 Hz) rhythms, conversion of firing rates to spike timings, and other interesting regimes. Due to the interplay between the delays and STDP, the spiking neurons spontaneously self-organize into groups and generate patterns of stereotypical polychronous activity. To our surprise, the number of coexisting polychronous groups far exceeds the number of neurons in the network, resulting in an unprecedented memory capacity of the system. We speculate on the significance of polychrony to the theory of neuronal group selection (TNGS, neural Darwinism), cognitive neural computations, binding and gamma rhythm, mechanisms of attention, and consciousness as “attention to memories.” </jats:p>",

Polychronous groups are found in large numbers in these networks and are proposed by Izhikevich ( 2006a ) to provide a neural basis for representation and memory. When exposed to a familiar stimulus, spiking neural networks produce consistencies in the spiking output data that are the hallmarks of PNG activation. Previous methods for studying the PNG activation response to stimuli have been limited by the template-based methods used to identify PNG activation. In this letter, we outline a new method that overcomes these difficulties by establishing for the first time a probabilistic interpretation of PNG activation. We then demonstrate the use of this method by investigating the claim that PNGs might provide the foundation of a representational system. </jats:p>",

To achieve this, we extended an\nexisting event-based algorithm [1], which introduced novel spatio-temporal features as a Hierarchy Of Time-Surfaces (HOTS). Built\nfrom asynchronous events acquired by a neuromorphic camera, these time surfaces allow to code the local dynamics of a visual scene\nand to create an efficient event-based pattern recognition architecture. Inspired by neuroscience, we extended this method to increase\nits performance. Our first contribution was to add a homeostatic gain control on the activity of neurons to improve the learning of\nspatio-temporal patterns [2]. A second contribution is to draw an analogy between the HOTS algorithm and Spiking Neural Networks\n(SNN). Following that analogy, our last contribution is to modify the classification layer and remodel the offline pattern categorization\nmethod previously used into an online and event-driven one. This classifier uses the spiking output of the network to define novel time\nsurfaces and we then perform online classification with a neuromimetic implementation of a multinomial logistic regression. Not only do\nthese improvements increase consistently the performances of the network, they also make this event-driven pattern recognition\nalgorithm online and bio-realistic. Results were validated on different datasets: DVS barrel [3], Poker-DVS [4] and N-MNIST [5].

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Hebb's idea of a cell assembly as the fundamental unit of neural information processing has dominated neuroscience like no other theoretical concept within the past 60 years. A range of different physiological phenomena, from precisely synchronized spiking to broadly simultaneous rate increases, has been subsumed under this term. Yet progress in this area is hampered by the lack of statistical tools that would enable to extract assemblies with arbitrary constellations of time lags, and at multiple temporal scales, partly due to the severe computational burden. Here we present such a unifying methodological and conceptual framework which detects assembly structure at many different time scales, levels of precision, and with arbitrary internal organization. Applying this methodology to multiple single unit recordings from various cortical areas, we find that there is no universal cortical coding scheme, but that assembly structure and precision significantly depends on the brain area recorded and ongoing task demands.</jats:p>",

Here, we present results from network simulations, taking full account of the variability in pulse packet realizations. We repeatedly stimulated a synfire chain of model neurons and estimated activity (a) and temporal jitter (sigma) of the spike response for each neuron group in the chain in many trials. The survival probability of the activity was assessed for each point in (a, sigma)-space. The results confirm and extend our earlier predictions based on single neuron properties and a deterministic state-space analysis [Diesmann, M., Gewaltig, M.-O., & Aertsen, A. (1999).

    "abstract": "One of the challenges when considering the motor control of birdsong is to understand how such a wide variety of temporally and spectrally diverse vocalizations are learned and produced. A better understanding of central neural processing, together with direct endoscopic observations and physiological studies of peripheral motor function during singing, has resulted in the formation of new theoretical models of song production. Recent work suggests that it may be more profitable to focus on the temporal relationship between control parameters than to attempt to directly correlate neural processing with details of the acoustic output.",

    "abstract": "Cortical circuits work through the generation of coordinated, large-scale activity patterns. In sensory systems, the onset of a discrete stimulus usually evokes a temporally organized packet of population activity lasting ∼50-200 ms. The structure of these packets is partially stereotypical, and variation in the exact timing and number of spikes within a packet conveys information about the identity of the stimulus. Similar packets also occur during ongoing stimuli and spontaneously. We suggest that such packets constitute the basic building blocks of cortical coding.",

    "abstract": "The descending, efferent projections of nucleus robustus archistriatalis were investigated in male zebra finches and greenfinches with injections of either biotinylated dextran amine or cholera toxin B-chain conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. The results show that in addition to the well-known projections to the tracheosyringeal motor nucleus and the dorsomedial nucleus of the intercollicular complex, there are other projections of comparable density to the ipsilateral nucleus ambiguus and nucleus retroambigualis. Within nucleus ambiguus, robustus axons terminate in close proximity to laryngeal motoneurons which were retrogradely labelled in the same bird by injections of cholera B-chain into the laryngeal muscles; and within nucleus retroambigualis robustus axons terminate in relation to bulbospinal neurons previously shown to project to regions of spinal cord containing motoneurons innervating abdominal expiratory muscles (J.M. Wild, Brain Res. 606:119-124, 1993). These projections of nucleus robustus thus seem well placed to coordinate syringeal, laryngeal, and expiratory muscle activity during vocalization. Other relatively sparse, but distinct, projections of nucleus robustus were found to nucleus dorsolateralis anterior thalami, pars medialis, to a narrow region between the superior olivary nucleus and the spinal lemniscus, and to the rostral ventrolateral medulla. Neurons in these last two locations were retrogradely labelled bilaterally following injections of cholera B-chain into nucleus retroambigualis of one side. Together with sparse contralateral projections of nucleus robustus to all brainstem targets receiving ipsilateral projections, potential pathways are thus identified by which the respiratory-vocal activity controlled by one side of the lower medulla can be influenced by the nucleus robustus of either side, thereby possibly bringing about bilateral coordination of respiratory-vocal output.",

    "abstract": "Songs of birds comprise hierarchical sets of vocal gestures. In zebra finches, songs include notes and syllables (groups of notes) delivered in fixed sequences. During singing, premotor neurons in the forebrain nucleus HVc exhibited reliable changes in activity rates whose patterns were uniquely associated with syllable identity. Neurons in the forebrain nucleus robustus archistriatalis, which receives input from the HVc, exhibited precisely timed and structured bursts of activity that were uniquely associated with note identity. Hence, units of vocal behavior are represented hierarchically in the avian forebrain. The representation of temporal sequences at each level of the hierarchy may be established by means of a decoding process involving interactions of higher level input with intrinsic local circuitry. Behavior is apparently represented by precise temporal patterning of spike trains at lower levels of the hierarchy.",

    "abstract": "Cortical neurons have been reported to use both rate and temporal codes. Here we describe a novel mode in which each neuron generates exactly 0 or 1 action potentials, but not more, in response to a stimulus. We used cell-attached recording, which ensured single-unit isolation, to record responses in rat auditory cortex to brief tone pips. Surprisingly, the majority of neurons exhibited binary behavior with few multi-spike responses; several dramatic examples consisted of exactly one spike on 100% of trials, with no trial-to-trial variability in spike count. Many neurons were tuned to stimulus frequency. Since individual trials yielded at most one spike for most neurons, the information about stimulus frequency was encoded in the population, and would not have been accessible to later stages of processing that only had access to the activity of a single unit. These binary units allow a more efficient population code than is possible with conventional rate coding units, and are consistent with a model of cortical processing in which synchronous packets of spikes propagate stably from one neuronal population to the next.",
