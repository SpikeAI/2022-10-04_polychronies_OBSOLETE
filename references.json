    "abstract": "  The plasticity of the conduction delay between neurons plays a fundamental role in learning. However, the exact underlying mechanisms in the brain for this modulation is still an open problem. Understanding the precise adjustment of synaptic delays could help us in developing effective brain-inspired computational models in providing aligned insights with the experimental evidence. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised biologically plausible learning rule for adjusting the synaptic delays in spiking neural networks. Then, we provided some mathematical proofs to show that our learning rule gives a neuron the ability to learn repeating spatio-temporal patterns. Furthermore, the experimental results of applying an STDP-based spiking neural network equipped with our proposed delay learning rule on Random Dot Kinematogram indicate the efficacy of the proposed delay learning rule in extracting temporal features.

    "abstract": "  Fitting network models to neural activity is an important tool in neuroscience. A popular approach is to model a brain area with a probabilistic recurrent spiking network whose parameters maximize the likelihood of the recorded activity. Although this is widely used, we show that the resulting model does not produce realistic neural activity. To correct for this, we suggest to augment the log-likelihood with terms that measure the dissimilarity between simulated and recorded activity. This dissimilarity is defined via summary statistics commonly used in neuroscience and the optimization is efficient because it relies on back-propagation through the stochastically simulated spike trains. We analyze this method theoretically and show empirically that it generates more realistic activity statistics. We find that it improves upon other fitting algorithms for spiking network models like GLMs (Generalized Linear Models) which do not usually rely on back-propagation. This new fitting algorithm also enables the consideration of hidden neurons which is otherwise notoriously hard, and we show that it can be crucial when trying to infer the network connectivity from spike recordings.

    "abstract": "  The principled design and discovery of biologically- and physically-informed models of neuronal dynamics has been advancing since the mid-twentieth century. Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) have accelerated this progress. This review article gives a high-level overview of the approaches across different scales of organization and levels of abstraction. The studies covered in this paper include fundamental models in computational neuroscience, nonlinear dynamics, data-driven methods, as well as emergent practices. While not all of these models span the intersection of neuroscience, AI, and system dynamics, all of them do or can work in tandem as generative models, which, as we argue, provide superior properties for the analysis of neuroscientific data. We discuss the limitations and unique dynamical traits of brain data and the complementary need for hypothesis- and data-driven modeling. By way of conclusion, we present several hybrid generative models from recent literature in scientific machine learning, which can be efficiently deployed to yield interpretable models of neural dynamics.

    "abstract": "Abstract\r\n            To investigate the importance of feedback loops in visual information processing, we have analyzed the dynamic aspects of neuronal responses to oriented gratings in cortical area V1 of the awake primate. If recurrent feedback is important in generating orientation selectivity, the initial part of the neuronal response should be relatively poorly selective, and full orientation selectivity should only appear after a delay. Thus, by examining the dynamics of the neuronal responses it should be possible to assess the importance of feedback processes in the development of orientation selectivity. The results were base on a sample of 259 cells recorded in two monkeys, of which 89% were visually responsive. Of these, approximately two-thirds were orientation selective. Response latency varied considerably between neurons, ranging from a minimum of 41 ms to over 150 ms, although most had latencies of 50‚Äì70 ms. Orientation tuning (defined as the bandwidth at half-height) ranged from 16 deg to over 90 deg, with a mean value of around 55 deg. By examining the selectivity of these different neurons by 10-ms time slices, starting at the onset of the neuronal response, we found that the orientation selectivity of virtually every neuron was fully developed at the very start of the neuronal response. Indeed, many neurons showed a marked tendency to respond at somewhat longer latencies to stimuli that were nonoptimally oriented, with the result that orientation selectivity was highest at the very start of the neuronal response. Furthermore, there was no evidence that the neurons with the shortest onset latencies were less selective. Such evidence is inconsistent with the hypothesis that recurrent intracortical feedback plays an important role in the generation of orientation selectivity. Instead, we suggest that orientation selectivity is primarily generated using feedforward mechanisms, including feedforward inhibition. Such a strategy has the advantage of allowing orientation to be computed rapidly, and avoids the initially poorly selective neuronal responses that characterize processing involving recurrent loops.",

    "abstract": "How animals adapt their behavior according to regular time intervals between events is not well understood, especially when intervals last several seconds. One possibility is that animals use disembodied internal neuronal representations of time to decide when to initiate a given action at the end of an interval. However, animals rarely remain immobile during time intervals but tend to perform stereotyped behaviors, raising the possibility that motor routines improve timing accuracy. To test this possibility, we used a task in which rats, freely moving on a motorized treadmill, could obtain a reward if they approached it after a fixed interval. Most animals took advantage of the treadmill length and its moving direction to develop, by trial-and-error, the same motor routine whose execution resulted in the precise timing of their reward approaches. Noticeably, when proficient animals did not follow this routine, their temporal accuracy decreased. Then, na√Øve animals were trained in modified versions of the task designed to prevent the development of this routine. Compared to rats trained in the first protocol, these animals didn‚Äôt reach a comparable level of timing accuracy. Altogether, our results indicate that timing accuracy in rats is improved when the environment affords cues that animals can incorporate into motor routines.",

We find precise repetitions of spontaneous patterns of synaptic inputs in neocortical neurons in vivo and in vitro. These patterns repeat after minutes, maintaining millisecond accuracy. Calcium imaging of slices reveals reactivation of sequences of cells during the occurrence of repeated intracellular synaptic patterns. The spontaneous activity drifts with time, engaging different cells. Sequences of active neurons have distinct spatial structures and are repeated in the same order over tens of seconds, revealing modular temporal dynamics. Higher order sequences are replayed with compressed timing.",

    "abstract": "Natural vision is a highly dynamic process. Frequent body, head, and eye movements constantly bring new images onto the retina for brief periods, challenging our understanding of the neural code for vision. We report that certain retinal ganglion cells encode the spatial structure of a briefly presented image in the relative timing of their first spikes. This code is found to be largely invariant to stimulus contrast and robust to noisy fluctuations in response latencies. Mechanistically, the observed response characteristics result from different kinetics in two retinal pathways (‚ÄúON‚Äù and ‚ÄúOFF‚Äù) that converge onto ganglion cells. This mechanism allows the retina to rapidly and reliably transmit new spatial information with the very first spikes emitted by a neural population.",

    "abstract": "Activity-driven modifications in synaptic connections between neurons in the neocortex may occur during development and learning. In dual whole-cell voltage recordings from pyramidal neurons, the coincidence of postsynaptic action potentials (APs) and unitary excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) was found to induce changes in EPSPs. Their average amplitudes were differentially up- or down-regulated, depending on the precise timing of postsynaptic APs relative to EPSPs. These observations suggest that APs propagating back into dendrites serve to modify single active synaptic connections, depending on the pattern of electrical activity in the pre- and postsynaptic neurons.",

    "abstract": "Neuron activity across the brain\r\n            \r\n              How is it that groups of neurons dispersed through the brain interact to generate complex behaviors? Three papers in this issue present brain-scale studies of neuronal activity and dynamics (see the Perspective by Huk and Hart). Allen\r\n              et al.\r\n              found that in thirsty mice, there is widespread neural activity related to stimuli that elicit licking and drinking. Individual neurons encoded task-specific responses, but every brain area contained neurons with different types of response. Optogenetic stimulation of thirst-sensing neurons in one area of the brain reinstated drinking and neuronal activity across the brain that previously signaled thirst. Gr√ºndemann\r\n              et al.\r\n              investigated the activity of mouse basal amygdala neurons in relation to behavior during different tasks. Two ensembles of neurons showed orthogonal activity during exploratory and nonexploratory behaviors, possibly reflecting different levels of anxiety experienced in these areas. Stringer\r\n              et al.\r\n              analyzed spontaneous neuronal firing, finding that neurons in the primary visual cortex encoded both visual information and motor activity related to facial movements. The variability of neuronal responses to visual stimuli in the primary visual area is mainly related to arousal and reflects the encoding of latent behavioral states.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              Science\r\n              , this issue p.\r\n              eaav3932\r\n              , p.\r\n              eaav8736\r\n              , p.\r\n              eaav7893\r\n              ; see also p.\r\n              236\r\n            \r\n          , \r\n            Neurons in the primary visual cortex encode both visual information and motor activity.\r\n          , \r\n            \r\n              INTRODUCTION\r\n              In the absence of sensory inputs, the brain produces structured patterns of activity, which can be as large as or larger than sensory-driven activity. Ongoing activity exists even in primary sensory cortices and has been hypothesized to reflect recapitulation of previous sensory experiences, or expectations of possible sensory events. Alternatively, ongoing activity could be related to behavioral and cognitive states.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              RATIONALE\r\n              Much previous work has linked spontaneous neural activity to behavior through one-dimensional measures like running speed and pupil diameter. However, mice perform diverse behaviors consisting of whisking, licking, sniffing, and other facial movements. We hypothesized that there exists a multidimensional representation of behavior in visual cortex and that previously reported ‚Äúnoise‚Äù during stimulus presentations may in fact be behaviorally driven. To investigate this, we recorded the activity of ~10,000 neurons in visual cortex of awake mice using two-photon calcium imaging, while simultaneously monitoring the facial movements using an infrared camera. In a second set of experiments, we recorded the activity of thousands of neurons across the brain using eight simultaneous Neuropixels probes, again videographically monitoring facial behavior.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              RESULTS\r\n              First, we found that ongoing activity in visual cortex is high dimensional: More than a hundred latent dimensions could be reliably extracted from the population activity. We found that a third of this activity could be predicted by a multidimensional model of the mouse‚Äôs behavior, extracted from the face video. This behaviorally related activity was not limited to visual cortex. We observed multidimensional representations of behavior in electrophysiological recordings from frontal, sensorimotor, and retrosplenial cortex; hippocampus; striatum; thalamus; and midbrain. Even though both behavior and neural activity contained fast‚Äìtime scale fluctuations on the order of 200 ms, they were only related to each other at a time scale of about 1 s. We next investigated how this spontaneous, behavior-related signal interacts with stimulus responses. The representation of sensory stimuli and behavioral variables was mixed in the same neurons: The fractions of each neuron‚Äôs variance explained by stimuli and by behavior were only slightly negatively correlated, and neurons with similar stimulus responses did not have more similar behavioral correlates. Nevertheless, at a population level, the neural dimensions encoding motor variables overlapped with those encoding visual stimuli along only one dimension, which coherently increased or decreased the activity of the entire population. Activity in all other behaviorally driven dimensions continued unperturbed regardless of sensory stimulation.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              CONCLUSION\r\n              The brainwide representation of behavioral variables suggests that information encoded nearly anywhere in the forebrain is combined with behavioral state variables into a mixed representation. We found that these multidimensional signals are present both during ongoing activity and during passive viewing of a stimulus. This suggests that previously reported noise during stimulus presentations may consist primarily of behavioral-state information. What benefit could this ubiquitous mixing of sensory and motor information provide? The most appropriate behavior for an animal to perform at any moment depends on the combination of available sensory data, ongoing motor actions, and purely internal variables such as motivational drives. Integration of sensory inputs with motor actions must therefore occur somewhere in the nervous system. Our data indicate that it happens as early as primary sensory cortex.\r\n              \r\n                \r\n                  Large-scale neural population recordings can be predicted from behavior.\r\n                  \r\n                    We used new recording technologies to simultaneously monitor the activity of ~10,000 neurons in a single brain area and ~3000 neurons from across the brain (top left). These neurons showed slow‚Äìtime scale patterns of coactivation restricted to subsets of neurons which were distributed across the brain (top right). The patterns of neural activity appeared to be driven by specific spontaneous behaviors that the animals engaged in during the experiment. We tracked these spontaneous behaviors by projecting a video recording of the mouse face onto a set of canonical ‚Äúeigenfaces‚Äù (bottom left) and used these projections to predict a large fraction of the neural activity (bottom right).\r\n                    t\r\n                    , time; PC, principal component.\r\n                  \r\n                \r\n                \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          , \r\n            Neuronal populations in sensory cortex produce variable responses to sensory stimuli and exhibit intricate spontaneous activity even without external sensory input. Cortical variability and spontaneous activity have been variously proposed to represent random noise, recall of prior experience, or encoding of ongoing behavioral and cognitive variables. Recording more than 10,000 neurons in mouse visual cortex, we observed that spontaneous activity reliably encoded a high-dimensional latent state, which was partially related to the mouse‚Äôs ongoing behavior and was represented not just in visual cortex but also across the forebrain. Sensory inputs did not interrupt this ongoing signal but added onto it a representation of external stimuli in orthogonal dimensions. Thus, visual cortical population activity, despite its apparently noisy structure, reliably encodes an orthogonal fusion of sensory and multidimensional behavioral information.",

    "abstract": "In order to detect members of a functional group (cell assembly) in simultaneously recorded neuronal spiking activity, we adopted the widely used operational definition that membership in a common assembly is expressed in near-simultaneous spike activity. Unitary event analysis, a statistical method to detect the significant occurrence of coincident spiking activity in stationary data, was recently developed (see the companion article in this issue). The technique for the detection of unitary events is based on the assumption that the underlying processes are stationary in time. This requirement, however, is usually not fulfilled in neuronal data. Here we describe a method that properly normalizes for changes of rate: the unitary events by moving window analysis (UEMWA). Analysis for unitary events is performed separately in overlapping time segments by sliding a window of constant width along the data. In each window, stationarity is assumed. Performance and sensitivity are demonstrated by use of simulated spike trains of independently firing neurons, into which coincident events are inserted. If cortical neurons organize dynamically into functional groups, the occurrence of near-simultaneous spike activity should be time varying and related to behavior and stimuli. UEMWA also accounts for these potentially interesting nonstationarities and allows locating them in time. The potential of the new method is illustrated by results from multiple single-unit recordings from frontal and motor cortical areas in awake, behaving monkey.",

    "abstract": "Hebb's idea of a cell assembly as the fundamental unit of neural information processing has dominated neuroscience like no other theoretical concept within the past 60 years. A range of different physiological phenomena, from precisely synchronized spiking to broadly simultaneous rate increases, has been subsumed under this term. Yet progress in this area is hampered by the lack of statistical tools that would enable to extract assemblies with arbitrary constellations of time lags, and at multiple temporal scales, partly due to the severe computational burden. Here we present such a unifying methodological and conceptual framework which detects assembly structure at many different time scales, levels of precision, and with arbitrary internal organization. Applying this methodology to multiple single unit recordings from various cortical areas, we find that there is no universal cortical coding scheme, but that assembly structure and precision significantly depends on the brain area recorded and ongoing task demands.",

    "abstract": "Cortical circuits work through the generation of coordinated, large-scale activity patterns. In sensory systems, the onset of a discrete stimulus usually evokes a temporally organized packet of population activity lasting ‚àº50-200 ms. The structure of these packets is partially stereotypical, and variation in the exact timing and number of spikes within a packet conveys information about the identity of the stimulus. Similar packets also occur during ongoing stimuli and spontaneously. We suggest that such packets constitute the basic building blocks of cortical coding.",
